# inc

This is where you put your include files. You should use the following conventions so that auto-loaders work as expected:

1. For functions, call your file `function.functionName.php`
2. For class, call it `class.SillyFace.php`
3. For files that contain mostly markup, `widget.subNav.php`
4. For files with mostly logic: `connect2db.php`
