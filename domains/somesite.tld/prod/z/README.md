# z

this folder contains assets like images, css, and js files. It is customary to break them up like this:

````
z
|-- assets
|-- js
|-- css
|-- lib
````

where images go in `assets`, .js files go in `js`, .css files go in `css`, and `lib` is reserved for libraries that include any combination of the above and can be thought of as a discrete package.
